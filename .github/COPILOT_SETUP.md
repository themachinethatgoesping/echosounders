# GitHub Copilot Integration Setup

This document describes how to set up the repository for optimal GitHub Copilot integration with automated testing.

## Overview

The repository has been configured with a dedicated CI workflow (`ci-copilot.yml`) that:
- Runs automatically on pull requests without manual approval for collaborators
- Provides quick feedback through a fast initial check
- Runs comprehensive tests similar to the existing CI workflows
- Is optimized for GitHub Copilot-generated pull requests

## Required Repository Settings

To ensure tests run automatically for GitHub Copilot PRs, configure the following repository settings:

### 1. Branch Protection Rules

Navigate to **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule** for the `main` branch:

#### Required Settings:
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Add required status checks:
    - `Quick validation`
    - `Comprehensive tests (Ubuntu)`
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**

#### Optional (Recommended):
- ✅ **Dismiss stale PR reviews when new commits are pushed**
- ✅ **Require review from CODEOWNERS**

### 2. Actions Permissions

Navigate to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**:

#### Required Settings:
- **Actions permissions**: "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
- **Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators**: 
  - Select "Require approval for first-time contributors who are new to GitHub"
  - This allows collaborators and org members to run workflows without approval

### 3. Dependabot and Security

Navigate to **Settings** → **Security & analysis**:
- Enable **Dependency graph**
- Enable **Dependabot alerts**
- Enable **Dependabot security updates**

## Workflow Details

### Quick Check (`quick-check` job)
- Runs on minimal Ubuntu environment
- Uses system packages where possible to avoid network dependencies
- Provides feedback in ~5-10 minutes
- Includes basic compilation and test validation

### Comprehensive Test (`comprehensive-test` job)  
- Only runs if quick check passes
- Similar to existing `ci-linux.yml` workflow
- Uses ccache for faster builds
- Runs full test suite

### Key Features
- **Fast feedback**: Quick check provides early validation
- **No manual approval needed**: Runs automatically for collaborators
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Full test suite runs on successful quick check
- **Error reporting**: Uploads build logs on failure
- **Timeout protection**: Prevents hung builds

## GitHub Copilot Usage

With this setup:

1. **Automatic Testing**: When GitHub Copilot creates a PR, tests run automatically
2. **Required Status Checks**: PRs cannot be merged until tests pass
3. **Fast Feedback**: Quick validation provides early feedback for iteration
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: Full test suite ensures code quality

## Excluding Codacy

The current setup focuses on functional testing and excludes static analysis tools like Codacy, as requested.

## Monitoring

Check the **Actions** tab to monitor workflow runs and ensure:
- Workflows run automatically on PR creation
- Status checks appear in PR status section
- Build times are reasonable (target: <15 minutes total)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Workflows require approval**: Check Actions permissions settings
2. **Status checks not required**: Verify branch protection rules
3. **Build failures**: Check error logs in workflow artifacts
4. **Network timeouts**: Workflows use system packages to minimize network dependencies

### Manual Testing

You can manually trigger the workflow using the "workflow_dispatch" event in the Actions tab.
