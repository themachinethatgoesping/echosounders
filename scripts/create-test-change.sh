This file was created to test the GitHub Copilot CI integration.

Test timestamp: $(date)
Test purpose: Verify automated CI execution on pull requests

The following should happen when a PR is created with this change:
1. GitHub Copilot CI workflow should trigger automatically
2. Quick validation job should run (~5-10 minutes)  
3. Comprehensive test job should run (~10-20 minutes)
4. Status checks should appear in the PR
5. PR should be mergeable only after tests pass

This validates that:
âœ… Workflow runs without manual approval
âœ… Tests execute properly
âœ… Status checks are enforced
âœ… GitHub Copilot can create PRs with automated testing
