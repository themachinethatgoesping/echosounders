TX / RX for EM 2040 sonar heads
1Multi-beam echo sounder system
The EM 2040 configuration for this installation. Examples for system are “Single Tx
single Rx”, “Single Rx dual Tx”.

Installations parameter and settings for transducers.
The distance offset units are meter, positive direction for X (along forwards), Y (starboard
across) and Z (vertical downwards). The angle offset are degrees for R (roll), P (pitch)
and H (heading). Time offset is in seconds for D (time delay).
Example is default setting for install offset and system settings
